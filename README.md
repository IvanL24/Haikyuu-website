## Haikyuu website project
### [Ivan Lavena](https://github.com/IvanL24/Haikyuu-website.git)

  Thank you very much for all the things that you taught us in the span of 15 weeks!!

 - this website is based on the manga and anime "HAIKYUU!!". I plan to keep this website updated to add more contents, like players involve in the said 
  subject.
 - will later on add back end stuff and make it more responsive to any device.
 - this will serve as a practice to keep my touch on programming after this course is over.

Still working on it to make it more appealing.
later on I will convert them to EJS and SCSS

## To do:
- font pairings
- clean up

## finished task
- decide on what to put for the third navigation
- edit  `client.js` to have the following for stats:
  - height
  - weight
  - position
- convert 'html' files to 'ejs'
- add partials
- fix responsiveness of typography
